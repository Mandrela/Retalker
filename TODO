Web interface -- -- -- -- -- -> buisness logic
command-line interface -/

logic:
    word module:
        three modes: with random words, letters or with words from custom dictionary

    input module:
        takes the word and then check if it mathces the given. Probably will give tips or statistic

    output module: -- done
        print word, probably with some changes -- depr

    session_manadger: -- done
        controls the session -- done

    session:
        use other modules to play with player -- done
        returns analytic data about success and failures: precentage, mistakes e.t.c.

cli:
    will be realtime interaction with logic -- done

    change mode option, change dict, add dict or whatever

    start'n'quit -- done

web:
    flask server with cooly designed site and so on
    interacts with logic essentially like the cli


1:
    Need dict mode for cli with all it need to work properly
    Still need web interface in first place rather than analytics
    Whanna see a leaderboard in web interface
